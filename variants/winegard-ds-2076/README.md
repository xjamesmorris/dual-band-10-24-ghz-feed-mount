## Bracket for the 10/24 feedhorn with a Winegard DS-2076 offset 76cm dish.

This was test printed with PLA on an Ender 3 Neo v2, with some allowance for srinkage. YMMV.

It has limited axial adjustment range, due to the location of the SMA connector & filter assembly. It works but may not be fully optimizable in terms of placing the phase center at the focus. 

I'm working on a a more generic (and more complex) version with a platform, which I'll link here once its published.
