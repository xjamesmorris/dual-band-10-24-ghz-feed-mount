This is a very simple bracket for mounting the <a href="http://www.w1ghz.org/">W1GHZ</a> dual band 10/24 GHz horn, as described <a href="https://rvhfg.org/wpr/w1ghz-dual-band-dish-feed/">here</a>. It's designed for home 3D printing, with PLA, ABS, or PETG (preferrably). These materials are not UV-stabilized, so for extended outdoor use, it may be helpful to spray paint them. A STEP file is provide for folk who want to experiment with CNC machining or other ideas.

Secure with M6 or 1/4" socket head screws, approximately 80mm or 3" long.
